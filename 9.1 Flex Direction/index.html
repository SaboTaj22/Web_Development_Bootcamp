<!-- Flex Direction -->
<!-- 
  flex-direction:row; (main axis is horizontal, from left to right. Cross axis from top to bottom.)
  flex-direction:column; (main axis from top to bottom. Cross axis from left to right.)
  flex-basis: 100px; (flexes along main axis of flex direction chosen.)
 -->

 <!-- Flex Layout -->
 <!-- 
  Items in the flex-box are the children. 
  The container is the parent.

  order: 0; (How to arrange things in a flex-box. Everything in flex-box set to 0 by default, set on CHILDREN)

  To make something go to the end of a flex-box, simply change it's number to something other than 0.
  (Biggest number goes to the end of the flex-box!)
  -->

  <!-- Flex Wrap (Set on parent container)
    flex-wrap: nowrap; (All elements added keep going in a straight line) 
    flex-wrap; wrap; (Elements wrap to next line once it reaches the end of container margin)
    flex-wrap; wrapreverse;(Wraps in reverse order)
  -->

  <!-- Justify Content (Set on parent horizontally)
  justify-content: flex-start; (Bunch everything to the left.)
  justify-content: flex-end; (Bunch everything to the right.)
  justify-content: center; (Bunch everything to the center.)
  justify-content: space-between; (Creates spacing between elements)
  justify-content: space-around; (Space on either side of items adds up to space between items)
  justify-content: space-evenly; (Evenly spaces everything)
  -->

  <!-- Align Items  (Set on parent vertically)
    align-items: flex-start (Bunches everything to beginning)
    height: 70vh; (have to set height for each one! vh means view height.)
    align-items: flex-end (Bunches everything to the bottom)
    align-items: center (Centers)
    align-items: baseline (similar to flex-start)
    align-items: stretch (vertically)

   --> 

   <!-- Align Self (WORKS WHEN NOWRAP)
      flex-wrap: nowrap; 
      align-self: flex-start; (Other types of properties available!)
      height: 70vh; (have to set height for each one! vh means view height.)
    - Selects a specific item and put a seperate flex styling on it

  <!-- Align Content (WORKS WHEN WRAP)
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-content: flex-start; (Other types of properties available!)
    height: 70vh; (have to set height for each one! vh means view height.)
  -->

  <!-- Flex Sizing -->
  <!-- 
    max-width (longest possible line of text) trumps flex-basis.
    min-width (longest word) If bigger than flex-basis, it trumps it.
    flex-basis: 200px; (Sets width)
    flex-grow: 0; (Fills up space that isn't taken by items, TO TURN ON set 0 to 1)
    flex-shrink: 0; (Shrinks until you reach the minimum width. TO TURN ON set 0 to 1)
    - if both grow and shrink are on, it grows to max width, and shrinks to minimum width.

    HOW TO WRITE grow, shrink, basis SHORTHAND; 
    flex: 1 1 0; or just write flex: 1;
