<!-- Cascading Style Sheets -->
<!-- 
  Applies internal and external css styles to an element.
  EX: Color of an item in a list is different from the color of other items
  - All items were changed to green but at the last minute one of them is turned to red.
 -->

<!-- Specificity and Inheritance:
4) Position: the lowest element is the most important
3) Specifity: Least -> most specific (element: li{}, class: .first-class, attribute: li[draggable], id #first-id)
2) Type: Least -> most (external: link element linking to a file, internal: in between style element, 
1) Inline: applied through attribute inside opening tag EX <h1 style=" ">)
Importance: keyword added to a property EX: color: green !important;
